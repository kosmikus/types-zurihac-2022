# An Introduction to Type Systems and Operational Semantics

**Zurihac 2022 "Advanced Track", 2022-06-12**

This is a repository accompanying the taslk, containing the slides
and sample code with some exercises.

## Abstract

In this workshop, Andres Löh will introduce some simple type systems, starting from 
a language with just a few base types, then adding variables and functions to reach
the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus and finally moving to System F, by adding polymorphism.

We will learn how to read and understand type rules, what desirable properties
type systems (should) have, and how to implement a type checker for such
systems.

The amount of Haskell knowledge you need in order to participate in this
workshop is actually rather small.

Although this session is part of the so-called “Advanced Track,” it is actually
rather introductory and will not teach you anything new if you are already
familiar with reading papers about type systems. But if you are primarily a
user of Haskell and have never really looked at the theoretical foundations,
then this session may be just what you have been looking for in order to
demystify some of the more theoretically focused papers and blog posts in the
Haskell world.
